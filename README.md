# Professional README Generator
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)]

## Description: 
I was tasked with creating a command line application that will dynamically generate a professional README file. The user is prompted with questions about their project and a README.MD file is generated with the users input.

## Installation:
* Clone repository
* Install Node.js (npm install)
* npm install inquirer

## Usage:
Open the terminal. When you type in index.js, you will be prompted with a series of questions that will then generate a README file in the src folder. See demo below.
