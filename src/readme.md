  ## Description:
  I was tasked with creating a command line application that will dynamically generate a professional README file. The user is prompted with questions about their project and a README.MD file is generated with the users input.

  ## Installation:
  Follow the steps below:
  Clone repository, install node.js, npm install inquirer

  ## Usage:
  Open the terminal. When you type in index.js, you will be prompted with a series of questions that will then generate a README file in the src folder.
